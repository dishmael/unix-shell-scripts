# unix-shell-scripts
This is a repository of various UNIX shell scripts I find useful.

## Installation
Copy the contents of [sysinit.sh](https://github.com/dishmael/unix-shell-scripts/blob/master/scripts/shell/sysinit.sh) locally under root and run the script. This will download/install packages via YUM, configure the local user ('dishmael'), and setup the user's home directory. Once complete, login as user.
